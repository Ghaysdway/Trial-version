                This year we came together in Berline for our first-ever
                HOTSAUCE conference. Over two days, some of the brightest minds
                in product, marketing, ecommerce, and UX joined us to connect
                over the future of digital experiences—and we had a blast.
              </p>
              <p>
                Join us next year for more visionary keynotes, peer-led
                roundtables, Hotjar masterclasses, and new connections. Be the
                first to learn about HOTSAUCE 2024 by subscribing to our
                newsletter.
